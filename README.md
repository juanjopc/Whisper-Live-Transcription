# Whisper Live Transcription üé§
An easy guide for your PC to transcribe any audio **free and in real-time** using Google Colab

---

### Step 1: Enable Your PC's "Internal Sound"

This allows the program to "listen" to the audio from your videos, calls, or games.

1.  On your taskbar (bottom-right), right-click the **Sound** icon.
2.  Choose **"Sound settings"** and then **"More sound settings"**.
3.  A new window will open. Go to the **"Recording"** tab.
4.  If you don't see **"Stereo Mix"**, right-click on an empty space and check **"Show Disabled Devices"**.
5.  Now, right-click on **"Stereo Mix"** and select **"Enable"**.
6.  Click **Accept** to save.

### Step 2: Set Up a Recording Profile

We‚Äôll use a separate browser profile so your main settings stay the same.  
Pick either **Google Chrome** or **Microsoft Edge**.  
> **Note:** You can‚Äôt record audio from one window to another in the same browser.

#### Option A: Google Chrome

1. Click your **profile icon** (top-right) and choose **‚Äú+ Add Chrome profile.‚Äù**  
2. Select **‚ÄúContinue without an account,‚Äù** name it (e.g., `record`), and click **Done**.  
3. In the new profile, open **Settings** (‚ãÆ menu), go to **Site Settings > Microphone**, and choose **Stereo Mix**.  
4. In **Settings > Performance**, under **Always keep these sites active**, click **Add** and add:  
   - `colab.research.google.com`  
   - `[*.]gradio.live`  

#### Option B: Microsoft Edge

1. Click your **profile icon** (top-right) and choose **‚ÄúSet up a new personal profile.‚Äù**  
2. In the new profile, open **Settings** (‚ãØ menu), go to **Privacy, search and services > Site permissions > All permissions**, and choose **Stereo Mix** under **Microphone**.  
3. In **Settings > System and performance**, under **Never put these sites to sleep**, click **Add site** and add:  
   - `colab.research.google.com`  
   - `[*.]gradio.live`  

### Step 3: Install an Extension

This prevents the transcription from stopping if you switch to another window.

1.  Install [**Always Active Window**](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/always-active-window-alwa/ehllkhjndgnlokhomdlhgbineffifcbj) from the Chrome Web Store.
2.  Click the **puzzle icon** (`üß©`) for extensions (top-right).
3.  Find the extension, click the three-dot menu (`‚ãÆ`) next to it, and choose **"Options"**.
4.  In the text box, paste the following (all on one line):
    ```
    colab.research.google.com, *.gradio.live
    ```
5.  Save the changes with the **Save Options** button.

### Step 4: Start Transcribing!

Now for the magic part.

1.  Open this link in your `record` Chrome profile:
    > **[Start Live Transcription](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1H8-Uc8O08d3VkBzLTQzJGgLZPkwAoimW?usp=sharing)**

2.  In the notebook's top menu, go to **"Runtime"** and click **"Run all"**.

3.  **Permissions:** It will ask you to **sign in** with your Google account and then **grant permission to use Google Drive**. Accept both prompts.

4.  **Wait a moment.** The program is setting up. At the end, you will see a **blue link** ending in `.gradio.live`.

5.  **Done!** Click that link. A new tab will open where you'll see a real-time text transcription of your PC's audio.

### How to Stop Everything

When you're finished, go back to the Google Colab tab, open the **"Runtime"** menu, and select **"Disconnect and delete runtime"**.

### About Free Usage and Paid Options

The **free** tier of Google Colab is great, but it has a weekly usage limit (usually around **3-5 hours**). If you exceed it, your session may be terminated.

**If you need it more often or for longer periods:**

I recommend buying "compute units" to avoid these limits.

-   You can buy **100 compute units** (valid for 3 months) for **$9.99** on the "Pay-As-You-Go" plan here: [**Buy Colab Compute Units**](https://colab.research.google.com/signup)
-   **100 units** ‚âà **55 hours of transcription**.

> For more details on performance and pricing, you can check this [reference article](https://mccormickml.com/2024/04/23/colab-gpus-features-and-pricing/).

**How to check your remaining units?**

In Google Colab, look in the top-right corner of the page. Find the 'Connect' button or the RAM/Disk display. Click the little down arrow (‚¨áÔ∏è) next to it, and then choose 'View resources', here you'll see your available units.
